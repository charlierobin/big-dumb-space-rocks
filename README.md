# Demo Unity game engine project: a version of “Asteroids” ... 

(Yes, ANOTHER ONE ...)

Just the first noodlings on an “Asteroids” type game: a nice cubemapped starfield background, big explosions (using both Unity’s inbuilt Shuriken particle system and the Detonator framework), etc etc.

Gameplay video at [charlierobin.github.io](https://charlierobin.github.io).

Plenty still to do: intro screen and difficulty levels, tidy up flying saucers and make them shoot back, implement the shield, make the starfield rotation random, and probably loads of other stuff.

But I was curious to see about getting the whole thing onto Github ...
